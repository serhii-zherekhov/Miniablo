# Miniablo

Indie rogue-like game prototype based on game Diablo(1996). Uses the same interface (mouse control) and game mechanics (random dungeon generation, isometric view, dungeon crawling, etc). Miniablo is currently in development. Two C++ algorithms in this project were taken from GitHub and carefully rewrit–µn on C# with minor changes (random dungeon generator https://github.com/ChechenItza/dungeon_generator and A* pathfinding https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/OneLoneCoder_PathFinding_AStar.cpp).
